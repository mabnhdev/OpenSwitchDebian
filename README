#########################################################################
# Standalone Debian version of OpenSwitch
#########################################################################

#
# This is still very much a work in progress!!!!
#

#########################################################################
Status/Errata
#########################################################################

* Support for the ASIC is not ported yet.

* ops-cli must be checked out in order for the build to succed since
  there are references to the ops-cli source in the build.  You don't
  have to do anything - the makefile takes care of it, but you should
  be aware.

* Debian packaging is not yet available for the new openvswitch, so
  this build reverts all repositories to a point before the new
  openvswitch 2.5.0 was merged into the OpenSwitch project.

#########################################################################

IMPORTANT!  For the time being, you must be a sudo'er.  A sudo'er without
            a password required would be much better.

=============================================
This has only been tested on Debian Jessie!!!

#
# Initial Setup - Do this once
#

* Create a working directory for the OpenSwitch Debian project
  and then cd to that directory.

* Clone the ops-debian repository.

* Change working directory to ops-debian
         cd ./ops-debian

* Make sure your machine is up-to-date.

  Execute the following script...
          ./setup_debian

#
# Building
#

* All checked out repositories can be found in ops-debian/src/<repository>

  You only need to check out a repository if you are planning to make
  changes to files in the repository.  To check out a repository, use
  the following command.

  make checkout-<repository>

* All repositories are built from shadow repositories located in
  ops-debian/build/shadow/<repository>.  If the repository has been
  checked out (ie. ops-debian/src/<repository> exists), then the shadow
  will be made up of symbolic links back to the checked out repository.
  If the repository has not been checked out, then the repository will
  be cloned into the shadow repository.

  Since shadow repositories are links back to the checked out
  repositories, all changes to files in the checked out repository
  will be reflected in the shadow repository.

  NOTE: ops-webui and ops-cli are not linked shadows; they are a
        hard copy of the repository.  Any changes you make to a the
        checked out source of the web-ui will NOT be reflected in
        the shadow.

  Many of the underlying repository makefiles seem to do quite a
  bit of rebuilding even though nothing has changed - there are
  dependency problems.  However, I want to keep modifications to
  the underlying makefiles to a minimum, so I've chosen not to
  force rebuilds of the underlying repositories.  This means that
  if you make changes in a checked out repository, you should
  force a full remake of the repository by first doing a clean.

  i.e. make clean-ops-fand && make ops-fand

* The following make targets are supported.

  make [all] - A full build of the entire system.  All debian
               packages are found in ops-debian/build.

  make <repository> - Make or remake a single repository.

  make clean-<repository> - Clean up generated objects for the repository.

  make checkout-<repository> - Clones the repository into the source area.
                               You must do this before making local changes
                               to files in a repository.  Make changes in
                               ops-debian/src/<repository>.

  make distclean-<repository> - Clean up generated objects and delete the
                                shadown directory.

  make clean - Clean up generated objects for all repositories.

  make distclean - Clean up all generated objects and shadow dirs.

  make update-all - Update all the checked out repositories.  You must have
                    all local changes stashed before trying to update.

  sudo make apt-repo - Place the generated debian packages into a
                       local apt repository.

* The following make flags are supported.

  DEBUG=[0|1] - Default =1.  Build debug images with no optimization.
  SIMULATION  - Default =0.  Build a simulation image suitable for
                             running on a VM.

  i.e. make all DEBUG=0 SIMULATION=1

* The build output and generated debian packages can be found in
  ops-debian/build.


#
# Updating
#

* You must update the ops-debian repository yourself.
  git pull --rebase


* Running the make update-all will update all repositories that you have
  checked out.

  NOTE: The system will perform a 'make distclean' before updating.

  make update-all
